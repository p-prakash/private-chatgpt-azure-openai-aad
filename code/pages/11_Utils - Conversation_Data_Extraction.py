User: Hi there, I'm off between August 25 and September 11. \
I saved up 4000 for a nice trip. If I flew out from San Francisco, what are your \
suggestions for where I can go?
Agent: For that budget you could travel to cities in the US, Mexico, Brazil, Italy \
or Japan. Any preferences?
User: Excellent, I've always wanted to see Japan. What kind of hotel can I expect?
Agent: Great, let me check what I have. First, can I just confirm with you that this \
is a trip for one adult?
User: Yes it is
Agent: Great, thank you, In that case I can offer you 15 days at HOTEL Sugoi, a 3 star \
hotel close to a Palace. You would be staying there between August 25th and September 7th. \
They offer free wifi and have an excellent guest rating of 8.49/10. \
The entire package costs 2024.25USD. Should I book this for you?
User: That sounds really good actually. Lets say I have a date I wanted to bringâ€¦would \
Japan be out of my price range then?
Agent: Yes, unfortunately the packages I have for two in Japan do not fit in your budget. \
However I can offer you a 13 day beach getaway at the 3 star Rose Sierra Hotel in Santo Domingo. \
Would something like that interest you?
User: How are the guest ratings for that place?
Agent: 7.06/10, so guests seem to be quite satisfied with the place.
User: TRUE. You know what, I'm not sure that I'm ready to ask her to travel with me yet anyway. \
Just book me for Sugoi
Agent:I can do that for you! 
User:Thanks!
Agent: Can I help you with some other booking today?
User:No, thanks!
